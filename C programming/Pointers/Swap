QUESTION To complete the program, write a function swap that takes two integers pointer a and b and swaps the values of a and b.

CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
void swap(int * a, int *b){
  int Default;                  //Allocating a Default memory location
  Default= *a;                  //Assigning the point of a to default, now default holds the address of a
  *a=*b;                        //Stores the value pointed to by b (De-Referencing) into the location pointed to by a
  *b= Default;                  //Stores the value pointed to by Default (not a), into the location pointed to by b

int main() {
  int a, b;
  a=10, b=20;
  //scanf("%d","%d", &a, &b);

  swap(&a,&b);

  printf("After Swapping, Value of A %d and Value of B %d",a,b);

  return 0;

}
